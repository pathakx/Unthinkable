## ⚡ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pathakx/Unthinkable.git
   cd Unthinkable
````

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended)**

   ```bash
   conda create -n <nanme> pyhton=3.10
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or edit the existing one) and add necessary credentials/configurations:

   ```bash
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   DEBUG=True
   ```

Would you like me to **enhance it** with:  
- badges (Python version, license, repo size, last commit),  
- a **project logo or banner**, and/or  
- a **demo screenshot/GIF section**?

Those make your GitHub page look much more polished and professional.
