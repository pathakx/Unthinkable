## ⚡ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/pathakx/Unthinkable.git
  cd Unthinkable
````

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended)**

```bash
conda create -n <nanme> pyhton=3.10
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Configure environment variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or edit the existing one) and add necessary credentials/configurations:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DEBUG=True
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the backend:

```bash
python backend.py
```

Depending on your configuration, the application will start processing data, serving APIs, or performing automated tasks.

## 🧠 Future Plans

* Add REST API endpoints
* Integrate a simple frontend dashboard
* Implement logging and monitoring
* Extend data-creation pipeline with AI models

Would you like me to **enhance it** with:  
- badges (Python version, license, repo size, last commit),  
- a **project logo or banner**, and/or  
- a **demo screenshot/GIF section**?

Those make your GitHub page look much more polished and professional.
